Running a python program
-----------------------------------

 Python provides us two ways to run a program:

	Using,
 	
	1) Interactive interpreter prompt (or) Interactive mode
   	
 	2) Script file


1) Interactive interpreter prompt
-------------------------------------------

- Python provides us the feature to execute the python statement one by one at the interactive prompt. It is preferable in the case where we are 
  concerned about the output of each line of our python program. 

- To open the interactive mode, open the terminal (or command prompt) and type python (pythonversionnumber in case if you have more than 
   one version of python installed on your system). 

- It will open Interactive mode where we can execute the python statement and check the output on the console. 

2) Script file
-----------------

- Interpreter prompt is good to run the individual statements of the code. However, we can not write the code every-time on the terminal. 

- To execute a set of statements, we need to write our code into a file which can be executed later. For this purpose, open an editor like notepad, 
  create a file and save it with extension .py(python uses .py extension) and write the python code in it. 
  Ex: first_program.py

- To run a file in python, run the command 'python filename.py' on the terminal (or) command prompt. 
   Ex: python first_program.py
