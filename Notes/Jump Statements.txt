Jump Statements
----------------------

Jump statements in python are used to alter the flow of a loop like skipping a part of a loop or terminating the loop. 

Jump Statements in Python
------------------------------------

1. break

2. continue

3. pass 

1. break
-----------

The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.

If break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), break will terminate the innermost loop.

Syntax of break
---------------------

break

Example
------------

# Use of break statement inside loop

for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        break
    print(val)

print("The end")

Output
---------

s
t
r
The end

Note
------

In this program, we iterate through the "string" sequence. We check if the letter is "i", upon which we break from the loop. Hence, we see in our 
output that all the letters up till "i" gets printed. After that, the loop terminates.

2. continue 
---------------

The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate, but continues on 
with the next iteration.

Syntax of continue
-------------------------

continue

Example
------------

# Use of continue statement inside loop

for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        continue
    print(val)

print("The end")

Output
---------

s
t
r
n
g
The end

This program is same as the above example except the break statement has been replaced with continue.

We continue with the loop, if the string is "i", not executing the rest of the block. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters except "i" gets 
printed.

3.pass
---------

pass statement is generally used as a placeholder.

Suppose we have a loop or a function has not been implemented yet, but it will be implemented in the future. The loop or function cannot have 
an empty body. If the loop or function has an empty body,the interpreter would complain. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that 
does nothing.

Syntax of pass
-------------------

pass
