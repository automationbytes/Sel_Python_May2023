Loops
--------

Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of code

while loop in Python
---------------------------

The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.

We generally use this loop when we don't know beforehand, the number of times to iterate.

Syntax of while Loop 
----------------------------

while test_expression:
    Body of while

In while loop, test expression is checked first. The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True. After one iteration, 
the test expression is checked again. This process continues until the test_expression evaluates to False.

In Python, the body of the while loop is determined through indentation.

Body starts with indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.


Python interprets any non-zero value as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.

Example
------------

i=1
while i<=5:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

Output
----------

1
2
3
4
5

Note
-------

In the above program, the test expression will be True as long as our counter variable i is less than or equal to 5 in our program.

We need to increase the value of counter variable in the body of the loop. This is very important (and mostly forgotten). Failing to do so will 
result in an infinite loop (never ending loop).

Finally the result is displayed.

while loop with else
---------------------------

We can have an optional else block with while loop as well.

The else part is executed if the condition in the while loop evaluates to False.

The while loop can be terminated with a break statement. In such case, the else part is ignored. Hence, a while loop's else part runs if no break 
occurs and the condition is false.

Example
------------

i=1
while i<=5:
    print(i)
    i=i+1
else:
    print("While loop has finished executing")

Output
---------

1
2
3
4
5
While loop has finished executing

Note
-------

In the above program, the test expression will be True as long as our counter variable i is less than or equal to 5 in our program.

On the sixth iteration, the condition in while becomes False. Hence, the else part is executed.

Negative condition:

while (False):
    print("it will exit")
else:
    print("Invalid Loop")
