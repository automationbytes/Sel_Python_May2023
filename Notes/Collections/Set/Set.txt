A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.

Creating a Set
-------------------

A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma.

Example
------------

my_set = {1, 2, 3}

print(my_set)


Output
----------
{1, 2, 3} # of any order
