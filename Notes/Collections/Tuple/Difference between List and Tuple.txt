List											Tuple
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A list is a collection which is ordered and mutable(changeable).		A tuple is a collection which is ordered and immutable(non 
										changeable).

Lists are not hashable.								Tuples are hashable.

Lists are usually used for storing a sequence of homogeneous elements.		Tuples are usually used for storing a sequence of heterogeneous 
										elements.

Since lists are mutable, iterating through list is comparatively slower than 	Since tuple are immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than 
with tuple. 									with list.									 
		
Lists that contain mutable elements cannot be used as key for a dictionary.	Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as key for a
				 			 			dictionary.

List elements are placed inside square braces and are separated by commas.	Tuple elements are placed inside square braces and are separated 
										by commas.
