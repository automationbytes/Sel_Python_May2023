List
-----

- Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.

- List is a collection which is ordered and mutable(modifiable). List allows duplicate elements. 

- In Python, elements in a list are enclosed within square brackets [] and comma is used to separate each element. 

- A single list may contain same (or) different DataTypes like Integers, Strings as well as Objects.

- Each element in a list has an index associated with it. The index must be an integer. The index position starts from 0. If a list contains 'n'  
  number of elements, then that list contains 0 to (n-1) indices. So, a list having 5 elements will have index from 0 to 4.

Example
------------

fruits=["apple","banana","grape","orange"]
print(fruits)

Output:
----------
  
  ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'orange']	
 
Index in list
----------------

You can access the list items (or) modify the list items by using the index operator [ ] and the index number.

Trying to access an element outside the index boundary will raise an IndexError. The index must be an integer. We can't use float or other types, 
this will result in TypeError.

Example
------------

fruits=["apple","banana","grape","orange"]
fruits[1]="papaya"
print(fruits[1])

Output:
----------

  papaya

Negative indexing
------------------------

Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on.

Example
------------

fruits=["apple","banana","grape","orange"]
print(fruits[-2])


Output:
----------

  grape

Slicing lists in python
-----------------------------

We can access a range of items in a list by using the slicing operator :(colon)

Example
------------

['apple', 'papaya', 'grape', 'orange', 'guava']

change or add elements to a list
-----------------------------------------

We can use assignment operator (=) to change an item or a range of items.

Looping Through a List
-------------------------------

You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:


a = ['TN', 'AP', 'KL', 'MP']
#for each loop
for i in a:
    print(i)
#for loop
print(len(a))
for j in range (len(a)):
    print(a[j])
