Python 2 vs. Python 3
-----------------------------

In most of the programming languages, whenever a new version releases, it supports the features and syntax of the existing version of the 
language, therefore, it is easier for the projects built in the language to switch in the newer version. However, in the case of python, the two 
versions python 2 and python 3 are very much different from each other.
