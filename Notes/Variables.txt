Variables
-------------

- Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store value. Variable is a name which is used to refer to a memory location. 
  This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

- Variable is also an identifier.

- Python is a dynamically typed language, hence we need not define the type of the variable while declaring it. The interpreter implicitly binds 
  the value with its type. 

- Variable names can be a combination of both letters and digits, but they must begin with a letter (or) an underscore.

- It is recomended to use lowercase letters for variable name. Number and number both are two different variables.

Naming Variables
------------------------

 An Identifier is used to identify the literals used in the program.Variables are the example of identifiers. The following rules should be followed
 while naming a variable:

    The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).
    
    All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore or digit (0-9).
     
    Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).
       
    Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the language.
    
    Identifier names are case sensitive for example myname, and MyName is not the same.
    
    Examples of valid identifiers : a123, _n, n_9, etc.
       
    Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n9, etc.

Declaring Variables and Assigning Values
------------------------------------------------------

- Python does not bound us to declare variable before using in the application. It allows us to create variable at required time.

- We don't need to declare explicitly variable in Python. When we assign any value to a variable that variable is declared automatically.

- The equal (=) operator is used to assign value to a variable.

Example
------------

 number=40 # An integer assignment
 
 name="Ram"  # A string

 salary=35000.00  # A floating point

Multiple Assignment
----------------------------

- Python allows us to assign a value to multiple variables in a single statement which is also known as multiple assignment.

- We can apply multiple assignments in two ways:

 1) By assigning a single value to multiple variables 

    Example:
    ------------

    num1=num2=num3=100
    print num1 
    print num2 
    print num3

   Output:
   ----------
 
    50  
    50  
    50  

  2) By assigning multiple values to multiple variables. 

   Example
   ------------

    a,b,c=5,10,15  
    print a  
    print b  
    print c  

   Output:
   ----------

     5  
    10  
    15  
    

 Here, the values will be assigned in the order in which variables appear.
