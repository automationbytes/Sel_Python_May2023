Comments
--------------

- Comments in Python can be used to explain any program code. It can also be used to hide the code as well.

- Comments are the most helpful stuff of any program. It enables us to understand the way, a program works. In python, any statement written 
  along with # symbol is known as a comment. The interpreter does not interpret the comment.

- Comment is not a part of the program, but it enhances the interactivity of the program and makes the program readable.

Python supports two types of comments:

1) Single Line Comment

2) Multi Line Comment:

1) Single Line Comment:
---------------------------------

In case user wants to specify a single line comment, then comment must start with ?#?

2) Multi Line Comment:

        Is a
